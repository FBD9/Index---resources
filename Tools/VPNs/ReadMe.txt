Several things should be considered when getting a VPN

1. Are there logs?

2. Where is the company based?

3. Are the executives and the company as a whole reputable?

4. Cost

5. How many people use the VPN?

6. Was the VPN compromised at any point in time?

7. What protocols are used?


A good example of a VPN to avoid would be PIA which has announced plans to sell out to Kape Technologies. Kape was formerly named Crossrider and has a history or producing malware and adware.Their CTO is also Mark Karpeles, a convicted criminal involved in the infamous Mt. Gox collapse and Bitcoin heist. They're also based in the USA, which is part of five eyes and has a bad history of respecting privacy. (Examples include PRISM, Fiber Optic cable listeners, Tempora, project bullrun, etc.)

A good example of a VPN to use would be protonvpn. ProtonVPN apps are open source, security audits are done relatively frequently, the company is based in Switzerland, a large amount of people use the VPN (anonymity), they keep no logs, and ProtonVPN uses secure protocols. They have an unlimited free plan if you cannot afford a VPN, too.
