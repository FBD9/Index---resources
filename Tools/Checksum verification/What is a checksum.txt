A checksum is the fingerprint of a given file - a bunch of
numbers and letters used to see if the file could possibly be corrupt.

"Each checksum is generated by a checksum algorithm. 
Without going into the technical details 
let’s just say it takes a file as input and 
outputs the checksum value of that file."

"So after you’ve downloaded an image,
you can generate an SHA-256 checksum for it
and verify that the checksum value matches the one listed on the site.
By verifying the files checksum value you can confirm whether or not
the file has been corrupted."
